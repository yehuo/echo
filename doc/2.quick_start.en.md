##  Config Proxy Account

When you need to start a proxy API, the proxy API should be config with its own account. So we will register a new account for proxy with `1008611-proxy` as username and password.

## Install Apk and login in App

After apk is installed on mobile phone, login in with previous account `1008611`.

After login in, you can see following view, export IP in it is the most important info on it, which could be used as your first IP proxy.

Besides, you will find the new export IP for mobile phone: `echonew.virjar.com:3317`, which is used to sending packages.

## Test Your Proxy IP with `curl`

When you work on Linux or Mac OS, `curl` could be your best tool to test you new proxy. When you work on Windows,`ip` command on cmd and chrome extends `SwitchyOmega` could be your best way to test the new proxy. 

Use new export IP on mobile phone to test Echo, and 

```shell
curl -x 1008611-proxy:1008611-proxy@echonew.virjar.com:33187 http://members.3322.org/dyndns/getip
```

As we registered, `1008611-proxy:1008611-proxy` is the export IP we create for proxy device, `echonew.virjar.com:33187` is the export IP of mobile phone. `http://members.3322.org/dyndns/getip` is the website we want to get, which shows the following page.

It is obvious that, after using Echo, the export IP of website has been changed. In debug info, the first red line shows true IP of mobile phone, the second red line shows export IP of current server, the third red line shows how to get to `www.baidu.com` through proxy server.
